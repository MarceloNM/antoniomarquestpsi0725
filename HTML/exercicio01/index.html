            <h3>10.1.2 Viewing Files Using a <i>Pager</i></h3>
            While viewing small files with the <b>cat</b> command poses no problems, it is not an ideal choice 
            for large files. The <b>cat</b> command doesn't provide any easy ways to pause and restart the 
            display, so the entire file contents are dumped to the screen.
            For larger files, use a <i>pager</i> command to view the contents. 
            Pager commands display one page of data at a time, allowing you to move forward and 
            backward in the file by using movement keys.
            <br>
            There are two commonly used pager commands:
            <br>
            - The <b>less</b> command provides a very advanced paging capability. It is usually the default 
            pager used by commands like the <b>man</b> command.
            <br>
            - The <b>more</b> command has been around since the early days of <i>UNIX</i>. While it has fewer features 
            than the <b>less</b>s command, however, the <b>less</b> command isn't included with all <i>Linux</i> distributions. 
            The <b>more</b> command is always available.
            <br>
            The <b>more</b> and <b>less</b> commands allow users to move around the document using keystroke commands. 
            Because developers based the <b>less</b> command on the functionality of the <b>more</b> command, all of 
            the keystroke commands available in the <b>more</b> command also work in the <b>less</b> command.
            The focus of our content is on the <b>more</b> advanced <b>less</b>s command. The <b>more</b> command is still 
            useful to remember for times when the <b>less</b> command isn't available. Remember that most of 
            the keystroke commands provided work for both commands.
